So vile men's torment was truly a pleasure
A plan that would change mankind for ever more
Catherine Blake slept fitfully
In the summer night, in the heat
She murmured gently and moved smoothly
This way and that
Oh, the beauty
Her luscious eyes, delicate fingers
Clawed at her sodden bed
Catherine smiled, took a fabulous breath
Of summer air and tasted death

Die Erorians' visit had been successful rewarding
With nights of female screams of whimpers
Lustful dreams
Night followed rampant night of
Delicate soft gasps
The ultimate attack on Heaven and its glories
Seduce them as they slept
Oblivious to their midnight tryst
The seed of doom was planted
Phantom raped in their dreams
The sad ones take their own lives
Slay their men night after night

Catherine Blake dreamt of a horror
Of passion too and of terror
Over her silent breast, shadows swept
Shades caressed

Motherhood was destroyed by the seed
And laid to waste
A great rift was born
Men and the world were torn
The daggers went in deep, vile and sickening
Women swept away all infancy from their wombs
And still the Lord God remained silent
No utterance, no movement, no tears

The earth became red
The cutting machines of man
Disgust and hatred for the lives of woman
The butchery, the savagery, did spill
Unto themselves
A chorus of agony from Heaven and rain poured
In a colossus of angels tears
The creature of all sins
The lord of the bleakest abode
Did wonder at the silence
What did the Almighty know?
All Hell did fill with the screaming souls
Of dead men

The mighty army of God did stand and wait
Hoping our lord would unleash them all
The great fiery pit, hordes ripped apart
Chaos ensued, screaming from the dark
Observing his darkened child
In the miserable corners of earth
The great heart of God will heal up the earth
The Lord watched as his beloved slipped silently
Back into the darkness below
